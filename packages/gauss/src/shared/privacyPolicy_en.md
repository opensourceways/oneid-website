# Privacy Policy

<hr/>

The openGauss Community understands the importance of your privacy and fully respects it. <u>**Please read this openGauss Community Privacy Statement ("Statement") carefully before you submit your personal data to us**</u>. If you have any questions about how we process your personal data, please feel free to contact us. Unless otherwise specified, "we" and "us" in this Statement refers to the **openGauss** Community.

## 1. How We Collect and Process Your Personal Data

**We generally do not require your personal data if you only browse the general content of the openGauss Community ("Community"). We will collect your personal data accordingly in the following circumstances:**

**a) Account Service**

1) When you register for an openGauss community account, we will collect your user name, **email address**, **phone number**, **password**, and **email**/**phone verification code**. A unique account identifier will be automatically generated. Refusal to provide this information will prevent account creation.
2) When you log in to the openGauss community using your user name, **email address**, or **phone number**, we will collect the provided credentials and **verification code** for authentication. Refusal to provide this information will prevent login.
3) When you log in using a third-party account (Gitee), we will collect your user name, user ID, nickname, avatar, and **email address** from that platform for authentication and code repository access management. When you log in using a third-party account that is not bound to any openGauss account, a new openGauss account with a unique identifier will be automatically generated, deriving its user name from your third-party account. Refusal to provide this information will prevent login via third-party accounts.
4) After logging in, you can optionally provide your avatar, nickname, and **company name**. This information is not required for using openGauss community features.
5) After logging in, you can modify your **email address**, **phone number**, and **password**, we will collect the provided credentials and verification code for authentication.
6) After logging in, you can bind your openGauss account to a third-party account (Gitee). We will collect your user name, user ID, nickname, avatar, and **email address** from the bound platform. Refusal to provide this information will prevent third-party account binding for login purposes.

**b) Mail Subscription**. When you use our mail subscription service, we will collect your **email address** and **name (optional)**. We will provide you with the email subscription service through this email address to facilitate your participation in discussions in the Community.

**c) Service Optimization**. To ensure the openGauss community functions as best as possible, and to provide better services for you, we will collect information about your browser, computer, and mobile device, including the **access timestamp**, **IP address**, **request details**, **access status**, **size of accessed resources**, **access source**, and **request user agent information**. Based on this information, we will collect statistics to understand the operating status of the openGauss community. The web analytics tool provider captures data about your activities on our website through cookies and other technologies and provides this data to us anonymously. No website user can identify this information.

**d) Contributor License Agreement Signing**. When you participate in code contribution through the Contributor License Agreement ("**CLA**") signing system (click [<here](https://clasign.osinfra.cn/sign/gitee_opengauss-1614047760000855378) to learn more), you need to submit your [relevant personal data](https://clasign.osinfra.cn/privacy) to the **CLA** signing system. We will obtain such personal data to verify whether you have signed the **CLA**, and to conduct relevant statistical analysis to understand how the Community is operating.

**e) Meeting Service**. When you use our meeting service, we will collect your Gitee ID for configuring related permissions. If you have meeting scheduling permission, we will collect your **email address** used when you edit the meeting details for the purpose of sending meeting invitations. If you enable automatically screen recording when you schedule a meeting, the recording will be uploaded to the third-party platform [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/) after the meeting so that more interested individuals and organizations can review your meeting.

**f) Content Release**. When you participate in Community meetings, Community activities, contribution in the open source Community, blogs, newsgroups, or Community organization, we will request your **avatar**, **name**, **email address**, **company name**, **position**, **school**, **individual resume** and Gitee ID for posting on our website so that developers can better understand the community, quickly make contact, and participate in the community.

**g) Meetup**. When you apply for an openGauss meetup, the community will collect your **phone number** and **email address** from the application form you fill in. The collected mobile number and email address will be used to contact you later to communicate about the meetup details. Furthermore, the community will request your name and company name for the purpose of meetup sign-ins, nameplates, and other related activities.

**g) Satisfaction Questionnaire**. When you fill out and submit the satisfaction questionnaire, we will collect your feedback on your experience with the community. If you voluntarily provide your contact information, we will process your **name**/nickname and **phone number** so that we can reach out to you for a deeper understanding of your feedback.

We may also collect your personal data from third parties, including other platforms or communities, within the scope of your authorization and consent, or obtain your personal data from other legal and public channels. We promise to process your personal data in strict accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Please read the privacy policies and user agreements of the third parties carefully. If a third party is required to provide your personal data when you use the openGauss Community, but you refuse to allow the third party to collect, use, transfer, or share your personal data when the third party provides services, you may not be able to use related services of the openGauss Community.
